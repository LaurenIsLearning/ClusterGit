Time Spent - 4:05pm-5:00pm (~1hr)

Activity - Researching Raspberry Pi's functionality, Internal git-concepts, containerization and orchestration.

Notes - [Raspberry Pi's https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLSegLrePWgIDKJTkdLyyQskh2HDdEL3y], Small computer, has all main 
components, just bite-sized and cheaper than an actual computer. Good for specific tasks compared to a computer. How-to-use and
install details also researched but not included because it's redundant to this summary. 
[Internal git concepts, https://youtu.be/e9lnsKot_SQ] I have not yet looked into source code, but watched this brief video on
how, well, it works internally. Shocker.
